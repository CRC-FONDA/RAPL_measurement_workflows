The bash scripts contain commands to execute the following steps in the indicated order.
1. Set up the workspace on the cluster by deleting old files.
2. Start RAPL energy monitoring on each used node on the cluster.
3. Start the execution of the Nextflow workflow on the cluster using "nextflow kuberun" OR using "nextflow run" remotely.
4. Monitor workflow execution and wait for it to complete.
5. After the workflow finished running, stop the energy monitoring.
6. Copy all relevant generated files containing information about the workflow execution and its energy consumption from the cluster to the local machine of the user.
7. Remove the generated files from the cluster.
8. Delete any remaining pods left over from execution of the workflow.
9. Run Python script for energy evaluation.

Run the script by using the following command in the terminal:
bash start_workflow_energy.sh

Note that the paths in the script need to be changed in order to be correct for your infrastructure.
